## 📋 Project Overview

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of medical insurance charges using advanced machine learning regression techniques. By analyzing demographic and health-related features of insured individuals, we develop predictive models to accurately estimate insurance costs and identify key cost-driving factors.

The analysis demonstrates professional data science practices including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model development, and performance optimization. The project serves as an end-to-end example of regression modeling applied to real-world insurance data.

**Completed as part of:** IBM Data Analysis with Python (Coursera)

## 🎯 Objectives

- **Data Quality**: Clean and preprocess raw insurance data to handle missing values and inconsistencies
- **Exploratory Analysis**: Investigate patterns, distributions, and correlations in insurance charges
- **Model Development**: Build and compare multiple regression models with varying complexity
- **Optimization**: Refine models using regularization techniques and polynomial feature engineering
- **Business Insights**: Identify actionable factors that significantly impact insurance costs

## 🔬 Analysis Workflow

### 1. **Data Wrangling & Preprocessing**
   - Replace placeholder values (`?`) with NaN
   - Impute missing categorical features with mode (most frequent value)
   - Impute missing numerical features with mean
   - Convert data types and round charges for consistency
   - Validate data quality and check for remaining issues

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - **Descriptive Statistics**: Summary statistics for numerical features
   - **Distribution Analysis**: Histograms, KDE plots, and box plots for outlier detection
   - **Categorical Analysis**: Count plots with frequency distributions
   - **Relationship Analysis**: Scatter plots (numerical) and box plots (categorical) vs charges
   - **Correlation Analysis**: Heatmap to identify linear relationships

### 3. **Model Development**
   
   #### Models Implemented:
   
   | Model                          | Description                                           | Key Features                    |
   |--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
   | Simple Linear Regression       | Single predictor (BMI only)                           | Baseline performance            |
   | Multiple Linear Regression     | All features included                                 | Captures multi-feature patterns |
   | Ridge Regression (L2)          | Regularized linear regression (α=1.0)                 | Prevents overfitting            |
   | Polynomial Ridge Regression    | Polynomial features (degree=2) + regularization       | Captures non-linear relationships |

### 4. **Model Evaluation Metrics**
   - **MSE** (Mean Squared Error): Average squared prediction error
   - **RMSE** (Root Mean Squared Error): Standard deviation of residuals
   - **MAE** (Mean Absolute Error): Average absolute prediction error
   - **R² Score**: Proportion of variance explained by the model

### 5. **Model Refinement & Optimization**
   - **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Test multiple alpha values (0.001 to 1000) for Ridge regression
   - **Feature Engineering**: Create polynomial features to capture interaction effects
   - **Performance Comparison**: Visual and tabular comparison of all models

## 📈 Key Findings

### Primary Insights

1. **🚬 Smoking Status - Dominant Factor**
   - Strongest predictor of insurance charges
   - Smokers face significantly higher premiums (often 3-4x higher)
   - Categorical feature with the highest correlation to costs

2. **⚖️ BMI - Secondary Health Indicator**
   - Positive correlation with insurance charges
   - Higher BMI associated with increased health risks and costs
   - Interaction with smoking status amplifies impact

3. **👴 Age - Progressive Cost Factor**
   - Direct relationship: older individuals pay more
   - Reflects cumulative health risks over time
   - Steady increase across age ranges

4. **👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Children & Region - Minimal Impact**
   - Number of children shows weak correlation
   - Regional differences exist but are relatively small
   - Gender shows no significant cost difference

### Model Performance Summary
